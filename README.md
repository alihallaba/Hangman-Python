# Hangman Game ðŸŽ¯
## Overview
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a hidden word from a text file and challenges the player to guess it letter by letter before running out of attempts.

## Features
âœ… Random word selection from a .txt file
âœ… ASCII-based hangman visuals
âœ… User-friendly command-line interface
âœ… Input validation for repeated and invalid guesses
âœ… Adjustable number of attempts

## How It Works
The game reads words from a text file (words.txt).
A random word is chosen as the hidden word.
The player guesses letters one at a time.
If the letter is correct, it is revealed in the word.
If incorrect, an attempt is lost, and the hangman drawing progresses.
The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
